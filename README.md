IsaacLab API with [MJWarp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) backend.

## Development Guide

Clone `mjlab`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kevinzakka/mjlab.git && cd mjlab
```

### Using uv

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Run a pre-trained motion mimic policy on the Unitree G1 huamnoid:

```bash
uv run --extra rl scripts/tracking/rl/play.py \
  --task Tracking-Flat-G1-Play-v0 \
  --wandb-run-path gcbc_researchers/mjlab_alpha/rfdej55h
```

To train the same motion mimic policy, run:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run --extra rl scripts/tracking/rl/train.py \
  --task Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --registry-name gcbc_researchers/csv_to_npz/lafan_cartwheel \
  --num_envs 4096
```

### Running tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code formatting and linting

```bash
uvx pre-commit install
```
