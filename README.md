# mjlab

IsaacLab API with [MJWarp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) backend.

## Installation

1. Install `mjwarp`.

```bash
pip install warp-lang --pre --upgrade -f https://pypi.nvidia.com/warp-lang/
pip install mujoco --pre --upgrade -f https://py.mujoco.org/
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp.git && cd mujoco_warp
pip install -e .[dev,cuda] --config-settings editable_mode=strict
```

2. [Install](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) `pytorch`. On a 5090, I used the below command:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

3. Install mjlab: `pip install -e ".[test,rl]"`

## Getting started

  --task Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --registry-name gcbc_researchers/csv_to_npz/run1_subject5:v0 \
  --num_envs 4096
```

```bash

aka make Brent proud

- [ ] Unit test everything
- [ ] Redo dataclass config correctly
- [ ] Make tyro configure everything in rsl_rl train and eval script
- [ ] Improve type checking across the board
- [ ] Switch to `uv`

**P2**

- [ ] Make it possible to seamlessly switch to CPU mujoco

## Debug

### Reset warp cache

```bash
python -c "import warp; warp.clear_kernel_cache()"
```
