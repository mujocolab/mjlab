# mjlab

IsaacLab API with [MJWarp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) backend.

## Getting started

### Motion Mimic

```bash
# Train.
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run --extra rl scripts/tracking/rl/train.py \
  --task Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
  --registry-name gcbc_researchers/csv_to_npz/run1_subject5:v0 \
  --num_envs 4096
```

```bash
# Play.
uv run --extra rl scripts/tracking/rl/play.py \
  --task Tracking-Flat-G1-Play-v0 \
  --wandb-run-path gcbc_researchers/mjlab_alpha/rfdej55h
```
