# Why mjlab?

## The Problem

GPU-accelerated robotics simulation has great tools, but each has tradeoffs:

**Isaac Lab**: Excellent API and RL abstractions, but heavy installation, slow startup, and Omniverse overhead make rapid iteration painful.

**MJX**: Fast and lightweight, but JAX's learning curve and poor collision scaling limit adoption.

**Newton**: Promising generic simulator supporting multiple solvers (MuJoCo, VBD, etc.), but the generic API requires everything to be converted into Newton's format, adding a translation layer. It's also brand new, so it doesn't yet have the vibrant ecosystem and community resources that MuJoCo and ISAAC have built over the years.

## Our Solution

**mjlab = Isaac Lab's API + MuJoCo's simplicity + GPU acceleration**

We took Isaac Lab's proven manager-based architecture and RL abstractions, then built them directly on MuJoCo Warp. No translation layers, no Omniverse overhead. Just fast, transparent physics.

### Why Not Add MuJoCo Warp to Isaac Lab?

We explored this first! But:
- Isaac Lab is deeply integrated with Omniverse/Isaac Sim's architecture
- Omniverse has high overhead
- Heavy dependency stack from trying to support many use cases
- Supporting multiple backends adds complexity and maintenance burden
- Starting fresh let us write lean, performant code

Isaac Lab recently added experimental Newton support, which will be a great way for existing Isaac users to try MuJoCo Warp. With mjlab, we chose to focus on a smaller codebase that we can support.

## Philosophy

**Bare Metal Performance**
- Direct MuJoCo Warp integration—no translation layers
- Native mjModel/mjData structures MuJoCo users know and love
- GPU-accelerated with minimal overhead

**Developer Experience First**
- One-line installation: `uvx --from mjlab demo`
- Instant startup (no compilation, no Omniverse loading)
- Standard Python debugging (pdb anywhere!)
- Fast iteration cycles

**Focused Scope**
- Rigid-body robotics and RL—not trying to do everything
- Clean, maintainable codebase over feature bloat
- Direct MuJoCo integration over generic abstractions

## When to Use `mjlab`

**Use `mjlab` if you want:**
- Fast iteration and debugging
- Direct MuJoCo physics control
- Proven RL abstractions (Isaac Lab-style)
- GPU acceleration without heavyweight dependencies
- Simple installation and deployment

**Use Isaac Lab if you need:**
- Photorealistic rendering
- USD pipeline integration
- Omniverse ecosystem features

**Use Newton if you need:**
- Deformable object simulation
- Multi-physics solver support
- Generic simulator abstraction

## The Bottom Line

mjlab isn't trying to replace everything. It's built for researchers who love MuJoCo's simplicity and want Isaac Lab's RL abstractions with GPU acceleration, minus the overhead.
